## The Neuromorphic Radar Project
This repository lists all the hardware design files for the neuromorphic radar project. 

Each channel comprises the ILO, the Mixer, and the spike encoder. They can be assembled using SMA connectors. 
![1-channel](https://github.com/kaizheng28/neuro-radar/assets/144567523/aa11b01c-7e67-4b84-a484-f320f9e5c70e)

The base board provides a stable power supply and mechanical structure for up to 6 channels of the NeuroRadar sensor. The assembled single-channel sensor can be attached to the base board through 2.54mm header pins.
